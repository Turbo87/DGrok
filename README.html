<h1>DGrok Delphi Parser</h1>

<p>DGrok is a parser for the Delphi programming language, together with tools to tell you things about your Delphi code.</p>

<p>(I know that's vague at this point, but hey, I haven't built those other tools yet, what do you want from me?)</p>

<p>Warning: this is an <b>alpha version</b> of DGrok and is <b>incomplete</b>. Just so you know.</p>

<p>The latest information about DGrok is available on the <a href="http://www.excastle.com/dgrok/">DGrok page</a> on my Web site.</p>

<h2>System Requirements</h2>

<p>DGrok requires the .NET Framework Redistributable version 2.0 or later.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you plan to compile the DGrok source code, you'll really want to have Ruby and Rake installed. Ruby is used to autogenerate some C# code and the HTML grammar document, and Rake is used to automate build tasks like "build all and run tests".</p>

<h2>What's included</h2>

<p>You can safely ignore the Source directory unless you plan to compile DGrok yourself. Here's what's included in the distribution:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><b>Grammar.html</b>, which documents the Delphi grammar. It also shows how much of the grammar is supported in this release. (You can compare this to the <a href="http://www.excastle.com/dgrok/Grammar.html">grammar doc on my Web site</a>, which shows how much is working in the latest pre-release code.)</p></li>
<li><p><b>DGrok.Demo.exe</b>, a demo app that you can play around with. I'll post more information about it on my blog; keep an eye on the <a href="http://www.excastle.com/blog/category/2.aspx?Show=All">DGrok category</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Support files for DGrok.Demo.exe.</p></li>
<li><p>The unit tests for DGrok (DGrok.Tests.exe). These all pass. They have to; otherwise my tools that build this ZIP file would yell at me and refuse to run. But feel free to run them.</p></li>
<li><p>The DGrok source code (in the Source directory).</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Compiling the source code</h2>

<p>You should be able to compile the included code as-is, using Visual Studio 2005 (or later) or MSBuild.</p>

<p>If you want to actually make changes to the code, you'll want to install Rake, and then open a command prompt in the Source directory and type:</p>

<blockquote><pre>rake</pre></blockquote>

<p>This will rebuild the Grammar.html file in the Source directory, do all the nifty codegen stuff, build everything, and run the tests. There are other Rake targets to do other things; see the Rakefile for details.</p>

<p>Beyond that, you're kind of on your own at this point.</p>

<p>Happy parsing!</p>
